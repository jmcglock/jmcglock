Hello Github!

My name is Joe McLaughlin (Mcglock for short).

I like cloud computing, cool tech tools, and trying out all the operating systems. I also own an ever-growing homelab.

My tech journey started as a mobile sales consultant at BestBuy. From there I became and Advanced Repair Agent for Geek Squad. When I needed a new challenge I moved onto the data center world, working as a technician for Amazon Web Services. I am currently working as a DevOps Manager for a software company.
